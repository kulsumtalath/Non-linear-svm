# Non-linear-svm
Non linear svm.
Non linear SVM can be used for overdiemnsional data.
Number of hyperplanes can be drawn and we can find the right hyperplane.
All hyperplanes are paremetrized by a vector(w) and a constant b.
It can be expressed as wx+b=0.
f(x)=sign(w*x)+b that correctly classifies our data.
Selection of a good hyperplane:
1st condition:Choose a hyperplane that divides or classifies the data correctly.
2nd condition:Which ever point is close to the hyperplane it is called Support vector.
The distance between the support vector is called margin.
Kernel Trick.
These are functions that takes low dimensional input space and transform into a higher dimensional space,
i.e., it converts non seperable probability into separble probility.
Z=X**2+y**2.
